# Information-Visualization-Project
The project involves selecting a publicly shared information visualization, critically analyzing it based on class principles, and proposing modifications for clarity, effectiveness, and neutrality. We will replicate the chosen visualization using a preferred software, apply the suggested improvements, and document the process in an essay. This essay will detail the rationale behind the selection, analysis, and modification of the graph, emphasizing concepts like data-ink ratio and cognitive theory. The objective is to create a more impactful visualization and share the insights in a community-friendly manner, thus enhancing public understanding of information visualization.

The project can be divided into the following sequence of steps:</br>
1.Select a relevant information visualization that you think should have some improvements. You must explain why you selected it, its impact on society, and so on.</br>
2.Provide a detailed explanation of the information visualization. We want to understand what is the story in the visualization, how to read it, and what are the visual variables. If applicable, use some of the concepts from cognitive theory to explain the effectiveness of the visualization. Also, describe its context.</br>
3.Replicate the information visualization using an information visualization library of your preference. The result should be as similar as possible to the original visualization.</br>
4.Propose changes that would improve the graph. Explain why those changes would improve the graph. Convince the reader about it.</br>
5.Implement the changes proposed in requirement 4.</br>
6.Ensure you have a smooth narrative, and do not assume the reader is an expert on information visualization. Moreover, the reader does not know the requirements you had in the assignment.
